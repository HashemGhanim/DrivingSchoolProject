# DrivingSchoolProject
 
Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ ..


As a project in a software engineering course,I prepared a driving school website.

It targets local schools that do not have websites that facilitate the student, instructor and school owner to communicate instead of phone calls.

A closed system similar to the university system, where the student and instructor are added to the school by the HR in the school after agreeing on fees and official papers.

Tools used in the project : 

ðŸ‘‰ Frontend tools:  React js , react-bootstrap

ðŸ‘‰ Backend tools:  Node.js / Express , MySql
